STEPS (Students and Transferees Enrollment and Processing System)

	It is no doubt that the enrollment week is the busiest week for students and school officials, especially for the new students and transferees. Being a new student or a transferee in a university has lots of paperworks and school interviews to make. The process alone of transferees and new students is not easy and will cost lots of time and money. We believe that if there is a system that can cater the CIT University's new students and transferees, it can shorten the process by reducing school paperworks, "office hopping", and minimizing enrollment lags in the process. Our goal is to have an easy and one time process because the easier the process, the more student enrollees. This system is only used during the CIT University enrollment week to cater new students and transferees. The target users of this system are the CIT University's new and transferee students, college departments, school registrar, and other school offices. 
	One of the main reasons of having a system like STEPS is not only to make the enrollment process easy and fast for new students, but to also provide a centralize data of students in the university. The university can make use of the student data for multi purposes like enrollment, new or old students tracking, alumni tracking, and etc. STEPS can reduce redundant paperworks by having students registered to the system for the school offices to access. This system will also help students process their enrollment step by step by having a dashboard for students and school administrators that displays the finished and unfinished processes. This system can stop students from jumping one office to another by creating a system ticket for the request and response aside from the traditional way where students need to line up at offices asking for an approval.
